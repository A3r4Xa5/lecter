NASA's Curiosity rover and the ESA's Mars Express satellite have detected traces of the gas in the planet's atmosphere, and ground-based telescopes spotted methane on Mars in 2003, according to NASA. The detections have been intriguing, since the gas seems to only appear in localized areas on Mars, according to Nick Schneider, a planetary scientist who works on NASA's MAVEN mission. 'If you see it in one place, it's a bullseye that says look here for something interesting,' said Schneider. 'Maybe it's a colony of life that's only survived in a certain region.'</p> <p>However, the methane measurements have also been temporary: the methane spotted by telescopes in 2003 all but disappeared by 2006. And Curiosity measured four big spikes of methane in late 2013, but it has yet to measure the gas again. That's weird, since methane has a lifetime of about 300 to 600 years - the length of time it takes for the Sun to break the molecule apart. Scientists don't know why the methane measurements are behaving this way, and that's why some researchers aren't sure the gas is even on Mars. For instance, one expert thinks the Curiosity rover <a href='http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9097883/nasa-curiosity-mars-rover-methane-life'>may have just detected methane leaking from the rover itself</a>.</p> <p> <figure><img src='https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Km6_odUuHdZpj_Csq5_lZDVM1nI=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6183855/Pack-ice_on_Mars-2.0.jpg'></figure></p> <small><i> A Mars Express instrument found methane at this area on Mars, Elysium Planitia.

The spacecraft's instruments will observe the atmosphere against the Sun, analyzing how the light changes the transparency of the gases. This will indicate what the Martian atmosphere is made of, says Svedhem. He notes the instruments are so sensitive, they can even determine if the methane is potentially coming from a biological source. 'It's by far the most sensitive type of mission one can do with Mars,' he said.</p> <p>However, it's going to take a while to know what types of gases the Trace Gas Orbiter finds. When the spacecraft reaches Mars, it will be spend over a year slowing down to reach the right speed and altitude for orbit - a process known as aerobraking. The probe will start studying the atmosphere once it reaches its intended orbit 250 miles (400 km) above the planet. That's slated to happen sometime in December 2017.</p> <h2>Exploring the floor</h2> <p> <figure><img src='https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NEOWP-fSGky51Ur_uEvALsgwbd8=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6183847/ExoMars2016_EDM_installation_on_top_of_TGO_20151125_1.0.jpg'></figure></p> <small><i>The ExoMars Schiaparelli lander.

Eventually, the heat shield and parachutes are jettisoned, as tiny thrusters on the bottom of the spacecraft ignite.

That's why both parachutes and thrusters are needed to prevent Schiaparelli from crashing into the surface. These landing techniques will all be used to land the future ExoMars rover in 2019 - but for a much larger object.
